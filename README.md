# EXPLORING-HACKER-NEWS
In this project, we'll compare two different types of posts from Hacker News, a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon. 

The two types of posts we'll explore begin with either 
-Ask HN  
-Show HN.  

Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "What is the best online course you've ever taken for Data Science?" Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.  We'll specifically compare these two types of posts to determine the following:  Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average? Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
